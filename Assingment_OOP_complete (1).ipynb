        "1. What is object orriented programig\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer** -- Object-Oriented Programming, or OOP, in Python is a way of writing code where you think about things as \"objects,\" just like in real life. For example, if you were making a program about animals, you wouldn't treat an animal as just some data scattered everywhere. Instead, you'd create something called a class in Python, which acts like a blueprint for that animal. This class would define what every animal should have â€” like a name and species â€” and what it can do â€” like making a sound or moving.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you want to create an actual animal in your program, you create an object from that class. Each object is like a real version of the blueprint with its own specific details. One animal might be a dog named Max, another might be a cat named Luna. Both are made from the same class, but they are separate objects with their own traits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python makes OOP simple and powerful. Inside a class, you can define attributes to hold data, and methods to define what the object can do. This way, the data and the behavior stay together, making the code easier to manage, especially when things get complex. If you ever need another type of animal thatâ€™s similar but slightly different, you can create a new class based on the old one â€” this is called inheritance. Python handles this smoothly too.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in Python, OOP helps you build cleaner, more organized, and reusable code by grouping data and functions into meaningful units that mirror the way we naturally think about the world.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer** -- A class in object-oriented programming is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It defines attributes to hold data and methods to define behaviors. When a class is used, it creates an object or instance. This helps in organizing code by grouping related data and functions together. Classes also support key OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism."

When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created from it. Each object can have different values for its attributes but share the structure and behavior defined by the class.

        "\n",
        "**Answer** - Polymorphism in Python works with inheritance by allowing a subclass to override methods from its parent class, so the same method call behaves differently depending on the object's actual class. This means you can write code that uses a parent class reference to call a method, and Python will automatically execute the subclass's version if it exists. For example, if both Dog and Cat inherit from Animal and override a method like speak(), calling speak() on an Animal reference will produce different outputs depending on whether the object is a Dog or a Cat, enabling flexible and reusable code through one interface with many implementations.\n"

This works because each method returns the object itself (usually self), allowing the next method to be invoked right after the previous one. It's a clean and concise way to perform a series of operations on an object without repeating the object's name. For example:"

        "**Answer** - The __call__ method in Python lets you use an object like a function. When you put parentheses after an object (like obj()), Python runs the code inside the object's __call__ method. This means you can make your objects do something when you \"call\" them, just like a regular function. For example, if you want an object that multiplies a number by a fixed value, you can define __call__ to do that, and then use the object like obj(5) to get the result.\n",
